    Martin Lewis Advocates For Revolutionary Bitcoin Home Based Opportunity To Improve The Living Standards Of British Families
</h1>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    A lot of Brits are now quitting their job and resorting to trade in bitcoins where they are making at least £2,265 per day.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel">

<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    Going by last week’s information leaked about Martin Lewis OBE, the founder of moneysavingexpert.com and expert in money advice, he is also making a substantial fortune from bitcoin trading despite being a venture he had advised people in Britain to be very cautious about.
</p>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    While talking to Rose Hill from the Daily Mail, Martin shared the primary reason for investing and encouraging British families to invest in <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel">Bitcoin Evolution</a>.
</p>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel">
        He believes that this new venture will stabilize many families financially in the UK. Despite not being the mastermind of this whole idea, Martin has invested at least £1.2m into the software that automatically trades bitcoin and guarantees you profit.
    </a>
</p>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    During a Forbes interview, Lewis admitted that in 2017, over half of the income generated by his business was from the investment he made in a single <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel">Bitcoin Evolution</a>. The profits from Bitcoin were more than the revenue earned from his moneysavingexpert.com website.
</p>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    Bitcoin, which has increased by over 3000% in the last few years, is not only a safe but also a stable asset in the face of political unrest being experienced across the world. This has triggered the increase in Bitcoin demand, making the Crypto World explode with much potential. It is fully decentralized and guarantees protection and full autonomy over your money, which, according to Martin Lewis, is what the United Kingdom needs to deal with economic issues.
</p>
<h2 style="width: 750px; font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;" >
    But how did Lewis come across this revolutionary Bitcoin opportunity?
</h2>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel">
        In a recent interview, he revealed that when he heard about this idea, he simply fell in love with it and took advantage of the movement. For him, this was to be an avenue through which thousands of British people’s lives would be changed.
    </a>
</p>
<h2 style="width: 750px; font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;" >
    Those who in 2010 invested in Bitcoin were now racking up 75 Million Dollars in dividends
</h2>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    But the Crypto World is still facing some serious opposition, especially from the banks. Lewis argued that the banks want to stop an average worker from accumulating wealth outside the established system's confines. He further admitted to continuing educating more people and encouraging them to invest in Bitcoin trading, regardless of the hate he was receiving from the banks for making this venture accessible to people.

</p>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    Bitcoin trading is gaining popularity in the UK, and most British families are now making a considerable amount of money. However, Lewis advises any aspiring investor in this program to be time conscious. According to him, this opportunity will not last for a long time, and most British people are likely to miss out. And with a few weeks, maybe months remaining to make holiday cash, economists are encouraging people to seize this opportunity.

<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    But is this true? Fiona Presley, a 37-year-old single mum of 2 boys from Stevenage, can give a comprehensive answer. She became unemployed last year in October, but fortunately for her, she was invited to take part in the beta test of this program this year in January after coming across an advertisement on Facebook.

</p>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    But she invested in it, which became one of the best decisions in her life. She started by watching a video then signing up, which was an easy and exciting experience just to learn something new. Fast-forward, Fiona makes about £7,000 every month. She receives money from <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel">Bitcoin Evolution</a> every Monday in the morning to her wallet. In case she wants to access the funds urgently, she can withdraw using her bank account, cheque, or PayPal.

But since it is a market that is not fully tapped, there is no cut-throat competition. It is for that reason people like Fiona are making a lot of money from this software. She is even much happier, and her kids can see that their toy chest is now looking better than usual.

    Getting Started
</h2>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    To get started, you will need a smartphone, tablet, or computer with reliable internet access. There are no specific skills that you require, as long as you are computer literate, and you can browse the internet. You are free to choose the hours you want to trade, which can range from 5 hours to 50 hours per week. There is no telemarketing or selling.
</p>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    You can have a look at Fiona’s guide below on how to get started with this program.
</p>
<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    Here's her step-by-step walkthrough:

<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    You will start by watching a video ad about <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel">Bitcoin Evolution</a>, then <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel"></a>sign up by submitting your email address and name</a> just below that video.

<p style="width: 750px; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">
    Once you have signed up and you have an account, the next step is <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel">to fund that account</a>. Your account manager will help you out. You will be expected to deposit at least $250 or £180, using a credit card such as American Express, MasterCard, and Visa.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
    <a style="color: blue !important; font-weight: bold; " href="https://altpoint.xyz/?o3nhb=c034390f5189fb81072b1&z3krvwqdph=englandbusiness.now.sh&d2jquvgt=vercel">

The software will start trading with immediate effect, and you can leave it to trade as you go about your work. For Fiona, when she came back and checked her balance, it was reading $1,592.37 or £1,127 just after one hour from the £180 she had initially invested.
</p>

He hopes that more people across the nation will adopt this new program.
